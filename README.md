# SynRM
This repository is created for the measurement data acquired through the identification of an experimental synchronous reluctance machine at the University of Győr. 

The simulations, that run in FEMM and wrapped in DTD, are available at https://github.com/KatonaMihaly/Experimental-SynRM-benchmark. It also contains the data used for Redesign for Remanufacturing of a Synchronous Reluctance Machine Considering the Circular Economy Conditions paper intended to the 1st Conference on Sustainability and for the paper titled Remanufacturing a Synchronous Reluctance Machine with Aluminum Winding: an Open Benchmark Problem for FEM Analysis supported by the ÚNKP-23-3-I-SZE-4 Hungarian New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the source of the National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund.
